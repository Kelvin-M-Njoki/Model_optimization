# Classification Model Optimization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on tackling a
classification problem by optimizing hyperparameters using techniques
like grid search. The notebook provides a structured approach to model
optimization and evaluation.

### Notebook Structure

1\. Data Loading and Exploration:  - We start by loading the
dataset to understand the predictor and response variables we\'ll be
working with.

2\. Data Preprocessing:  - Binarization of the target variable
and splitting the data into train and test sets.

3\. Modeling with Support Vector Classifier (SVC):  - We apply a
Support Vector Classifier to model the data.

4\. Custom Metric Definition:  - We define a custom metric, the
log-loss, to evaluate the model\'s performance.

5\. Hyperparameter Optimization:  - Utilizing grid search
strategy, we optimize the hyperparameters of the SVC to enhance the
model\'s performance.

### Usage

To utilize the notebook effectively:

1\. Clone the repository to your local machine. 2. Open the Jupyter
Notebook \`classification_model_optimization.ipynb\` using Jupyter
Notebook or JupyterLab. 3. Execute each cell sequentially to follow the
step-by-step analysis and implementation. 4. Customize the code and
parameters as needed for your specific classification problem.

\### Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

\- Python 3.x - Jupyter Notebook - scikit-learn - numpy - pandas

Ensure these dependencies are installed in your Python environment.
